The game will have a simple and clean design. The main screen will display the snake, food, and the player's score. There will be arrow keys for controlling the snake's movement. The game will also have a pause button for pausing and resuming the game. The levels and difficulty options will be accessible from a settings menu.

## Anything UNCLEAR:
