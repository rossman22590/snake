## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main"),
    ("game.py", "Game"),
    ("snake.py", "Snake"),
    ("food.py", "Food"),
    ("level.py", "Level")
]
```

## Task list:

```python
[
    "main.py",
    "game.py",
    "snake.py",
    "food.py",
    "level.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'game.py' file contains the main logic for controlling the game. It manages the game state, score, and handles game events such as starting, ending, pausing, and resuming the game.

The 'snake.py' file contains the logic for controlling the snake. It handles the movement of the snake, eating food, and checking for collisions.

The 'food.py' file contains the logic for generating food at random positions on the game board.

The 'level.py' file contains the logic for setting the difficulty level of the game.

The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the program and initializes the game.

Make sure to initialize the Pygame library and handle keyboard input in the 'main.py' file.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:

We need to clarify how the game will be started and how the main loop will be implemented in the 'main.py' file.
