## Implementation approach:
For the snake game implementation, we will use the Pygame library, which is a popular open-source library for game development in Python. Pygame provides a simple and efficient way to create games with smooth controls and graphics. It also has built-in functions for handling keyboard input and collision detection, which are essential for implementing the snake game.

## Python package name:
```python
"snake_game"
```

## File list:
```python
[
    "main.py",
]
```

## Data structures and interface definitions:
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Game{
        -int score
        -int high_score
        +start_game()
        +end_game()
        +pause_game()
        +resume_game()
        +update_score()
    }
    class Snake{
        -int length
        -int speed
        -List[Tuple[int, int]] body
        +move()
        +eat_food()
        +check_collision()
    }
    class Food{
        -int x
        -int y
        +generate()
    }
    class Level{
        -int difficulty
        +set_difficulty()
    }
    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Level: has
```

## Program call flow:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food
    participant L as Level
    M->>G: start_game()
    G->>S: move()
    S->>F: eat_food()
    F->>F: generate()
    S->>S: check_collision()
    S->>G: update_score()
    G->>M: end_game()
    M->>G: pause_game()
    G->>M: resume_game()
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:
The requirements are clear and there are no unclear points.
